                    <h4>Bio</h4>
                    <p>I'm passionate about the design process and working across it. From shaping the product vision
                        and strategy all the way to refining all the details of a user flow to enhance usability. I will
                        say that most of my most recent work has been in the front half of the double diamond design
                        process. Conducting research to turn insights and early concept ideas into product priorities
                        for cross-functional teams. In my next role, I hope to continue doing that and work on projects
                        where we're iterating
                        on existing experiences for maximum customer delight and ease of use. I want to continue
                        developing my ability to deliver functional and usable digital products.</p>
                    <p>I thrive when I can work as a UX generalist and am excited to explore new industries I've never
                        worked in before.</p>

                    <p>When I‚Äôm on vacation or looking for a place to escape to, I love visiting cities that allow me to
                        imagine what a car-free life would be like. I'm excited to see how transit in the U.S. can
                        catchup to experiences abroad and work for all people.</p>
