                    <p>In my professional experience as a designer, I‚Äôve been responsible for a combination of research
                        and design responsibilities. This has included conducting contextual inquiries to understand
                        human behavior, identifying user needs that align with business goals, outlining details of a
                        user flow, and much more. What my prior experience has taught me, is how to adapt and add value
                        throughout the product development lifecycle. I‚Äôm a design generalist, who‚Äôs curious,
                        collaborative, and adaptable.</p>

                    <h3>What I specialize in</h3>
                    <h6 class="pt-2">Clarifying how business needs overlap with customer needs</h6>
                    <p>I work closely with product and engineering partners to understand business goals and priorities.
                        My role is to help businesses grow in alignment with what
                        their users want. I ground my teams in a deep understanding user behaviors, motivations, and
                        goals.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Adapting my skillset to new problems and teammates</h6>
                    <p>I'm comfortable wearing multiple hats, which has been beneficial when working across the design
                        process in a number of problem spaces. I want to use my problem-solving toolbelt to
                        help people live happier, easier, and more sustainable lives.</p>
                    <h6>Offering evidence-driven perspectives</h6>
                    <p>In my experience the most effective way to share your perspective is to show the reasons that led
                        you to your beliefs. And that doesn‚Äôt just mean having quantitative proof, but the complicated
                        human
                        story to explain why.</p>
                    <h6>Collaborating with a variety of people</h6>
                    <p>Each cross-functional partner has a meaningful and unique perspective to offer in the product
                        development lifecycle. I take pride in creating a safe and open space to contribute differing
                        opinions and beliefs.
